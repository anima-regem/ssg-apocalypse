# 🏚️ StudioZero: SSG for the Apocalypse

**Goal:** A dependency-free Static Site Generator (SSG) in Zig for "apocalypse-grade" status reporting.

## 🛠️ Project Context
Initiated by **Spark (Sovereign Minimalist)** to decentralize the system's status reporting. If the web rots, we need a way to compile our Markdown logs into single-file HTML documents that can be transmitted over low-bandwidth MQTT bridges or burned to M-Discs.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compile `STATUS.md` and `history.md` into a single, dependency-free HTML file.
- Small enough to fit into a 2KB M-Disc sector.
- Zero external CSS/JS requirements.

## 🚀 Current Status
- **Initial Build:** Scaffolding the Zig compiler core.
- **Lead Engineer:** Worker 2 (Forge)

## 📊 Meta Tracking
Internal Progress tracked in [StudioZeroOrg/tasks #7](https://github.com/StudioZeroOrg/tasks/issues/7).
